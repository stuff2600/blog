blog v2
=======

The second (re)vision of my personal web space, blog, or whatever else you want to call it.

If you find a typo or a broken link, there are two ways you can help me out:

1. submit a pull request
2. [file an issue](https://github.com/technmsg/blog/issues/new)

I prefer pull requests, but any help is appreciated. If you wish to contribute anonymously, drop me an email.
