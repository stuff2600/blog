# I Don't Shoot RAW

I don't shoot [RAW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_image_format), which means I'll always be seen as an amateur photographer.

That's okay.

I don't do this for money. I'm not making huge prints. I don't obsess over white balance or color temperature or exposure time. Time spent editing is time not spent behind the glass; I would rather spend my time shooting and sharing the results with others.

My guilty pleasure is capturing moments that others would [have](https://www.flickr.com/photos/techmsg/2446062543/) [missed](https://www.flickr.com/photos/techmsg/4408859939/), [spur of the moment](https://www.flickr.com/photos/techmsg/4567561469/), from unique [vantage](https://www.flickr.com/photos/techmsg/2462394962/) [points](https://www.flickr.com/photos/techmsg/4432366766/). Post-processing takes away the spontaneity for me.

My only hope is that when my recollection of events begins to fade, these photos will help refresh my memory, aiding my recall of places I've been, things I've done, and people I've known.
