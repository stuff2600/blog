# Six Years with Solar

It's been six years since I [installed solar panels on my roof](/v2/solar/) and things are still going great:

87% of my home's electricity needs have been provided by the sun.

75% of my installation costs have been recouped through incentives, reduced reliance on my utility's electric supply, SREC sales, and referral bonuses from my installer.

$0.18 per kilowatt-hour is my effective cost for electricity that the solar PV system has produced so far, including all taxes and fees. That rate is falling about one cent per quarter; if that trend continues the system could potentially pay itself off in another 4-5 years.

What else has happened?

Not much since [my year two update](/v2/2017/02/07/solar-two-years.html). I'm still very hands off, the system just silently does it's thing.

There's far more installs in my neighborhood now: a few dozen within a three minute walk of my house, and easily one hundred in the surrounding area.

That's the good news, but there have been a few hiccups.

## SREC Market Recovering

In August 2015 the price of a single SREC was $165 but a year later it had dropped to $28. The price fell even further in 2017.

With the [passage of the Maryland Clean Energy Jobs Act (CEJA) in May 2019](https://www.srectrade.com/blog/srec-markets/maryland-clean-energy-jobs-act-ceja-passes-into-law), the SREC market has been recovering nicely.

>This legislation requires 50% of Marylandâ€™s energy to come from renewable sources and 14.5% from in-state solar, by 2030.

Since the passage of CEJA the price has jumped up to $65 and since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic has further increased to $80. SREC Trade [reports](https://www.srectrade.com/blog/srec-markets/maryland/maryland-srec-market-update-2) a 23% drop in build-out rate over the previous twelve months. If I had to guess, there's a lot of installations on hold as consumers priorities shift toward their health and that of their families.

## Cost of Electricity

The cost of electricity over the past couple years has been on the decline, ranging from $0.10 to $0.12 per kilowatt-hour from my utility (including supply, delivery, taxes, and fees).

My effective rate for electricity I produce is $0.18 per kilowatt-hour and falling. Within two years I could easily see my effective rate being less expensive than from my utility.

## Monitoring Discrepancies

Over a six year period my production meter recorded 350 kWh more than SunPower's monitoring software (roughly 5 kWh/month on average). Occasionally the SunPower hardware needs a reset, has recording issues, or SunPower's data processing backend isn't working properly.

I've adjusted some of my tracking spreadsheets to account for this and allow trueing-up with the production meter periodically as it's a far more accurate instrument.

## Production Shortfalls

It's possible that the discrepancies listed above could account for *some* of the production shortfalls I've seen. Even taking the shortfalls into consideration, the system is still only producing 92% of it's warranted output on a monthly basis.

I could submit for my installer to reimburse me for this shortfall. They've given me the runaround the last two years and frankly it isn't worth the hassle.

## Continuing On...

Six years in, the sun is still shining. I'm still pleased with my decision to install solar PV panels on my home.

If I bought another property, I wouldn't hesitate to install solar PV there as well.
